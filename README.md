# scimitar-capital-product-design
This repository contains design artifacts from a branding and merchandise project for Scimitar Capital, a startup crypto investment company. The materials include logo variations, visual system explorations, embroidery tests, and final production samples, documenting the process of translating a digital brand identity into physical merchandise.

## Repository Contents Files Included (and what each one shows)

### 1) `scimitar logo.pdf` — Concept directions + rationale (4 pages)
This PDF captures the early concept phase, where I explored multiple logo directions and documented the reasoning behind each option.

**What’s inside:**
- **Iconography + values** exploration (blade/scimitar form, color palette)
- **Direction 1: Runescape reference** — simplified scimitar mark and lockups, with notes on what it communicates and potential concerns
- **Direction 2: Motion / illustrative** — more dynamic scimitar imagery, with notes on visual energy vs. readability/seriousness
- **Direction 3: Clean and corporate** — minimal, more traditional marks and lockups, including notes on brand fit and distinctiveness

**Purpose:** show design thinking, tradeoffs, and how each direction was evaluated.

### 2) `logo colorways.jpeg` — Logo iteration sheet (variants + lockups)
This image is a consolidated overview of logo variations created during refinement.

**What’s shown here:**
- multiple symbol orientations and stylizations
- different wordmark lockups (stacked vs. horizontal)
- background/color tests (light vs. dark applications)
- simplified icon-only versions and exploration of mark readability

**Purpose:** show iteration breadth and how the final direction was refined through variants.

### 3) `stitch tests.png` — Embroidery test results + size/spacing comparisons
This file documents how the logo translated from a digital design to embroidery.

**What’s shown here:**
- target size reference (**3.5” x 2.75”**)
- stitch/fill method comparisons (auto fill vs. contour fill vs. guided fill)
- thread spacing tests (0.25 vs. 0.15 vs. 0.125)
- photo of stitched samples and a real garment application for scale/placement

**Purpose:** show production constraints and how design details were adjusted for manufacturability and legibility.

## Note
This repo is documentation-first and focuses on the iterative design process and physical production constraints, rather than code.
